# Week2-Challenge-Online-Portfolio-Page
This weeks challenege consisted of creating a code from scratch to create a web application for our own online portfolio.
## About 
The purpose of this challenge was to create a web application from scratch since we weren't given a starter code this time around. What I am building is a portfolio page that I will be updating as the course progresses where I will be showcasing all the work I have done. I applied the skills I have learned up until now in this point of the course.
